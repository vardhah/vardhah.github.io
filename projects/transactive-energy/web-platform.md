## Overview

A web-based platform enabling researchers to collaboratively design, simulate, and evaluate resilient and transactive smart grid systems through a browser — without local software installation. The platform integrates GridLAB-D simulation with domain-specific modeling tools.

## Key Features

- **Browser-based** — No local installation required; collaborative access via web
- **GridLAB-D Integration** — Full simulation of power distribution systems
- **Transactive Energy Modeling** — Dynamic pricing and energy trading scenarios
- **Resilience Evaluation** — Testing grid response to disturbances and cyber attacks

## My Contributions

I developed the GridLAB-D Design Studio, the web-based frontend and simulation orchestration layer that enables collaborative smart grid modeling and evaluation.

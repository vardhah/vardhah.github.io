## Overview

A comprehensive tutorial and survey covering the cybersecurity landscape of Operational Technology (OT) networks. This work provides a structured overview of threats, vulnerabilities, defense mechanisms, and emerging AI-based approaches for securing industrial control systems.

## Topics Covered

- Architecture and protocols of OT/ICS networks (SCADA, DCS, PLCs)
- Threat landscape and attack taxonomies for industrial systems
- Defense strategies: network segmentation, anomaly detection, intrusion detection
- AI/ML-based approaches for OT security monitoring
- Challenges and open research problems

## My Contributions

I co-authored this tutorial drawing on my experience building OT cybersecurity testbeds and AI-based defense systems under the DARPA CASTLE program.

## Overview

This work presents an autonomous cybersecurity testbed specifically designed for Operational Technology (OT) networks. The testbed enables realistic simulation of industrial control system (ICS) environments for training and evaluating AI-based cyber defense agents under the DARPA CASTLE program.

## Key Features

- **Realistic OT Network Simulation** — Emulates SCADA systems, PLCs, and industrial protocols (Modbus, DNP3) in a controlled environment.
- **Autonomous Attack & Defense** — Supports both automated attacker and defender agents for adversarial training scenarios.
- **Configurable Topologies** — Allows researchers to define custom network layouts representing different industrial sectors (power grids, water treatment, manufacturing).
- **Metric Collection** — Comprehensive logging and evaluation framework for measuring defense agent performance.

## My Contributions

I contributed to the design and implementation of the OT network simulation layer, including integration of SCADA protocols and development of the evaluation metrics framework.

Working with the Vanderbilt ISIS team under Professor Janos Sztipanovits, I contributed to three core thrusts: **rare event failure testing** for learning-enabled controllers, **out-of-distribution detection** for runtime assurance, and **AI-driven UUV design optimization** for the program's underwater vehicle challenge.

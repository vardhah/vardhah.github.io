## Overview

Extended ML-simulation fusion methods for propeller optimization, combining learned surrogate models with numerical CFD simulation to achieve optimized propeller designs for autonomous underwater vehicles.

## Approach

The method fuses ML predictions with CFD simulation results, using the ML model for rapid initial screening and CFD for high-fidelity validation of promising candidates. This hybrid approach balances computational efficiency with design accuracy.

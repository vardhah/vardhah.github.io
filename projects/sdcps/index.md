Under the DARPA SDCPS program, I developed AI-driven approaches for autonomous engineering design optimization. My work focused on integrating **Bayesian optimization**, **deep learning surrogates**, and **active learning** with CAD-CFD toolchains (FreeCAD + OpenFOAM) to dramatically accelerate the UUV design process.

The Vanderbilt ISIS team's **Design.R** project (PI: Péter Völgyesi) built the AI Co-Designer and **Design Oracle** — a system where automated designers submit component graphs and receive full multi-domain performance evaluations. The **ATHENS** project provided the Design Oracle infrastructure used across UUV and UAV design targets.

All research code is [open-sourced on GitHub](https://github.com/vardhah).

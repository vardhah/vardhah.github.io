## Overview

A systematic CFD-based search for the universal minimum drag resistance hull form for underwater vehicles. This work evaluates a comprehensive design space of hull geometries using OpenFOAM simulations to identify fundamental limits on drag reduction.

## Approach

- Parameterized hull geometry space covering major UUV form factors
- High-fidelity OpenFOAM RANS simulations for each candidate
- Analysis of drag components (pressure drag, friction drag) across the design space
- Identification of optimal hull aspect ratios and nose/tail geometries

__Brief bio:__ I am currently pursuing my PhD in Computer Science department at Vanderbilt University. I finished my B. Tech in Electrical and Electronics Engineering in 2009. During undergraduate, I won multiple national and international robotics competitions that ignited my interest in embedded programming and system design. I worked on different position in India in heavy engineering and data driven modeling from 2010-2017. In 2018, I moved to Vanderbilt university to pursue my higher education. I earned M.S. degrees in computer science from Vanderbilt University. During my research career at Vanderbilt, I am affiliated with [Institute of Software and Integrated System](https://www.isis.vanderbilt.edu/) and work with Professor [Janos Sztipanovits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janos_Sztipanovits). Apart from my research focus, I also develop web-based opensource domain specific modeling and simulation tool for smart grid simulation  called [GridLAB-D Design Studio](https://cps-vo.org/group/gridlabd). My research has been supported by organizations including DARPA, National Science Foundation, and NIST. 

__Research summary:__ I am interested in advancing research in AI and applied mathematics and its application in system design and its operation. Our use cases involve the most complex engineering domains like Finite element analysis, Computational fluid dynamics, Computer aided design and learning-enabled nonlinear control.  For application purposes, I primarily use computational physics, simulation process, scientific computing using numerical methods and develop novel algorithms using AI and mathematics for tackling these problem. To this end, the AI sub-field that I work with are Deep Active Learning, Surrogate Modeling, Bayesian optimization, Bayesian experimental design, reinforcement learning, computer vision, transformer-based learning, graphical probabilistic modeling, Deep Learning, and other machine learning methods. In system operation, my research interest is optimization/control of nonlinear system using reinforcement learning with focus of research is to find rare event failures and out-of-distribution and anomaly detection in trained reinforcement learning controller for reliable AI-based system operation.
